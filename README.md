Business Objective
This project will enable the bank to develop a more granular understanding of its customer base, predict customers' response to its telemarketing campaign and establish a target customer profile for future marketing plans.

By analyzing customer features, such as demographics and transaction history, the bank will be able to predict customer saving behaviors and identify which type of customers is more likely to make term deposits. The bank can then focus its marketing efforts on those customers. This will not only allow the bank to secure deposits more effectively but also increase customer satisfaction by reducing undesirable advertisements for certain customers.

Load Data
Use pandas to read in the dataset bank-additional-full.csv used separators as ‘;’ and assign to a meaningful variable name (df). 
The data is highly imbalanced with No: Yes = 89:11. 
Training the models
I build basic models for Decision Tree, Support vector machine, KNN and Logistic Regression. Found that Logistic Regression has less training time and better Train and Test Accuracy than others.

Recommendations:
After improving the model, I recommend Decision Tree Classifier as better model for the dataset taken up for research. 
Also, the telemarketing team should focus on the Student and Retired individuals for a better subscription rate.
